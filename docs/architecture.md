# Saira AI Companion – Architecture Documentation

## Overview

Saira is an empathetic, intelligent AI companion that understands user emotions, remembers conversations, and adapts to different personalities across devices. Saira focuses on privacy-first processing, with all emotion detection and conversation data stored and processed locally.

## Main Components

| Component | Description                                                         | Interfaces/APIs           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Core AI   | Handles business logic, orchestrates emotion detection, memory, etc | Internal classes/services |
| Voice     | Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, wake-word detection                 | Microphone/Audio APIs     |
| Emotion   | Detects, analyzes, and provides feedback on user emotions           | Internal, UI feedback     |
| Memory    | Vector embeddings, context management, long-term memory             | Vector DB APIs            |
| UI        | User interface for all platforms                                    | React (Web), iOS (Swift)  |
| Mobile    | iOS companion app                                                   | Apple APIs, REST, BLE     |
| Speaker   | Smart speaker interface                                             | Device SDK, Audio APIs    |

## Data Flow

1. **User Input:** Voice or text input is captured via the UI or device microphone.
2. **Speech Processing:** Audio processed into text (STT), analyzed for emotional cues.
3. **Emotion Analysis:** Emotion detection modules extract emotional state.
4. **Core AI:** Business logic chooses responses, adapts personality mode, consults memory.
5. **Memory:** Vector DB and embeddings provide context from past interactions.
6. **Response Generation:** Appropriate, emotionally-aware response is generated.
7. **Output:** Response is delivered through UI, voice (TTS), or other device outputs.
8. **Local Storage:** All sensitive data remains local, encrypted, and never leaves the device.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend/Core:** Node.js 18+, Python 3.9+, custom AI modules
- **Frontend/UI:** React (Web), Swift (iOS)
- **AI/ML:** HuggingFace Transformers, custom emotion models
- **Database:** Local vector DB (e.g., Chroma, Faiss, or custom)
- **Voice Processing:** Web Audio API, CoreML, or platform-native solutions
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions, scripts for setup and deployment
- **Security/Privacy:** Local encryption, no cloud processing

## Deployment Environments

| Environment | Purpose                          | Notes                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Development | Local dev, feature testing       | macOS, iOS, emulators      |
| Staging     | Pre-release, integration testing | (Planned)                  |
| Production  | End-user deployment              | Mac app, iOS app, Speakers |

## Key Design Decisions

- **Privacy-first:** All processing and storage are local; encrypted sync for multi-device.
- **Emotion-aware:** Core feature is real-time, on-device emotion detection.
- **Extensible personalities:** Modular design allows for new personality modes.
- **Multi-platform:** Designed for seamless context and memory sharing across Mac, iPhone, and smart speakers.

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for device sync.
- No personal data or audio leaves the device.
- Local storage of all conversation data and emotion metrics.
- Compliance with privacy best practices and user transparency.

## Extensibility and Modularity

- Plugin-ready architecture for new emotion models, platforms, or personality modes.
- Separation of concerns: core, UI, memory, voice, emotion, platform-specific code.
