- **Node.js:** 18+
- **Python:** 3.9+
- **macOS:** 12+ (for Mac app deployment)
- **iOS:** 15+ (for iPhone app deployment)
- **Build Tools:** Xcode (for iOS), Homebrew, etc.
- **Production Environment:** Secure VM or server (for backend, if any)
- **Environment Variables:** See `config/` and `.env.example`

---

## 2. Local Deployment (Development)

```bash
# Start backend and frontend
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm run dev
```

- For iOS: Open `src/mobile/` in Xcode and run on simulator or device.
- For Mac app: Build and run from the appropriate directory (instructions TBD).

---

## 3. Production Deployment

_This section will expand as the deployment target is finalized._

- **Build production assets:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **Package and distribute:**

## 4. Monitoring & Logging

- Ensure proper logging is enabled for debugging.
- Monitor resource usage on devices (CPU, memory, storage).

---

## 5. Rollback and Recovery

- Always keep backups of user data (encrypted, local).
- For app updates, ensure users can revert to a previous version if needed.

## 6. Security Considerations

- All processing and storage are local; no personal data leaves the device.
- End-to-end encryption for device sync.
- Follow principle of least privilege for any environment-specific permissions.

---

## 7. Common Issues

- Dependency conflicts: Run `npm ci` or clean `node_modules`.
- Build errors: Check Node/Python/Xcode versions and update as needed.
- Permission issues: Ensure correct app permissions (microphone, storage, etc.).
